ioi-training
============

This repository initially began when I was mentoring Malvika Joshi for her preparations with the International Olympiad in Informatics. 99+ percent of the contributions here are Malvika's, we mostly set it up for easy code review. :-) 

Currently, this repository is used in conjunction with an [IOI community](http://alpha.commonlounge.com/community/e4aac00a033a40ec96657906c6e1b43c) on [Commonlounge](http://commonlounge.com/). If you are interested in preparing for the IOI (or are interested in competitive programming / algorithms), I encourage you to join the community. The community is suitable for people of all experience levels. If you are an IOI alumni or have competitive programming experience, we would love for you to help us by making contributions, answering peoples questions, or moderating the community.
