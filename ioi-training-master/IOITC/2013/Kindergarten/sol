 When we are given the configuration of the seating arrangement and want to find out how many ways there are to obtain it, we try all

 the places to seat the current child and find out how many ways were there to obtain the arrangement the child sat. This is the same
 idea used in the algorithm for the previous subtasks but its not necessary that the configuration should be of the form which tells us
 exactly which seats are taken. Observe that if we are given the sizes of the groups of the children, it does not matter in what order
 they appear, the number of ways to obtain the will be the same for any permutation of those sizes. Because it does not matter where we
 want to seat the current child, the sizes obtained before seating it will be the same (permutations of each other). Thus this can save
 a lot of recomputation. 
 There are only 28629 possibilities for this set of sizes so we can use recursion and memoization.
